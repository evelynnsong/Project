1. Project Introduction
1.1 Background
The pay gap between men and women is the Elephant in Room. The pay gap is all around us, but many people don't notice it. Gender Pay Gap refers to the pay gap between genders. Currently, the same occupation is likely to offer different amounts of pay for different genders, and this situation seems to be widespread around the world. More specifically, globally, women tend to earn less than men. 
For example, in Hong Kong, there is a 13 percent gap, which means that for the same job a man earns say $100, a woman will only earn $87. We also hear or feel other gender pay gap in our daily life, so this phenomenon has caught our attention and triggered the following research contents.
1.2 Research Significance
In recent years, the gender pay gap has been recognized as an issue that can reflect the status of women and gender equality. It is an issue that requires sustained and long-term attention from society. By mining the data characteristics of the gender pay gap, we have the opportunity to make targeted recommendations to society to promote gender-equal development.
